From there, little is left to the imagination: two teams on an American football field take turns with possession of a duck (rubber, presumably, given the distances achieved) attempting to kick it (as the author ad-libs, a fowl ball) to the goal line... and victory! In the C64 original you would specify the short or long punt, so as to not drastically overshoot near the goal line and be forced to buy a new duck with a point deduction. Also, sporadically the game would declare that an interception had occurred (or, steady yourselves, an ab-duck-tion) A modern remake has been produced for contemporary operating environments with numerous interface and gameplay enhancements.",

By 2022, the game was played not by humans, but two teams of seven robots. To spice things up, the usual pig skin ball was replaced with a 350 pound bomb. Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real sport, although the 'downs' are replaced by the bomb's heat gradually increasing towards 'critical'. After this it will explode and possession will be swapped. This is prevented when you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 'cool'. Field goals and punts are not featured - the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive. Control passes from the quarterback (thrower) to the intended catcher as soon as a pass is released. The two-player game is co-operative - on offense one player passes and the other receives.",
